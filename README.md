Hey buddy, Thanks for visiting the page.
In this example, we take filename and search keyWord as inputs and tends to get the set of all snippets as provided in problem statement.
here, we use to buffer the data from the disk file constantly and manipulate our goal. 
We check the occurence of the keyWord in every sentences (in-between seperators like dot.) and we yield the snippet until final chunk.
And thusby we got the List of Snippets.
